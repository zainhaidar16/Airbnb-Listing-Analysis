# Airbnb Listings Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Airbnb listings, focusing on key metrics and trends within the dataset. The analysis includes exploring various aspects such as popular neighbourhoods, accommodation sizes, pricing, host activity, and property types. Visualizations are used extensively to convey the insights derived from the data.

## Data Source
The analysis is based on the `Listings.csv` file, which contains detailed information about Airbnb listings. This dataset includes various features such as neighbourhood, price, property type, room type, and number of reviews.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used for creating visualizations.

## Features of the Analysis
The project includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Airbnb listings.
- Identification of the top 10 neighbourhoods by the number of listings.
- Analysis of the most popular accommodation sizes.
- Evaluation of average prices in different neighbourhoods.
- Examination of host activity, particularly focusing on hosts with the most listings.
- Distribution analysis of property and room types.
- Investigation of review patterns and availability trends.

## Visualizations
Key visualizations in this project include:
1. Bar charts for top neighbourhoods, accommodation sizes, and hosts.
2. Pie charts for property type and room type distributions.
3. Histograms for price distribution.
4. Line and bar graphs for trends in reviews and availability.

## Installation and Usage
To run this project:
1. Ensure you have Python installed, along with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks to see the analysis and visualizations.
